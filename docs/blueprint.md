# **App Name**: Requirement Refiner

## Core Features:

- Multi-file Upload: Allows users to upload multiple files at once (Wordpad documents, PDFs, and audio files).
- Progress Indicator: Visual indicator for the file uploading and processing status.
- Requirement Extraction: Send the files to a large language model to analyze, extract and present both functional and non-functional requirements. The AI tool can process various file types (text and audio) to understand user needs.
- Display Enriched Requirements: Displays the refined requirements in a structured, readable format.
- Clarification Suggestions: The large language model may use a tool to ask the user to clarify aspects of their requirement, if the extracted functional or nonfunctional requirements are ambiguous.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7EC4CF) for a calm, reliable feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean, unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Teal (#368F8B) for important actions and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, readable style.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any code snippets.
- Use clear, outline-style icons from a set like Feather or Line Awesome for actions and file types.
- Clean, card-based layout to separate different functional areas. Prioritize clarity and ease of use, ensuring an intuitive design.
